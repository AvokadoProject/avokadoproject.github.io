      <description>Kaspresso is a UI test framework based on Espresso and UI Automator. Developed by Kaspersky. It greatly simplifies writing autotests for Android apps and offers multiple features, where the most important are:
 100% stability and reliability Faster execution of Espresso and UI Automator commands. For some commands in the latter, the speed increase is 10x Excellent test readability thanks to a readily comprehensible DSL An incredible interceptor mechanism allowing to intercept all actions and asserts in one place Clear logging Support for ADB calls Autotest writing philosophy and a DSL compliant with this philosophy Fast screenshot tool And much more.</description>

      <description>Over the several years that we have been doing autotests for mobile apps, a great deal of valuable experience has been accumulated. Working on autotests, related tools and infrastructure requires different skills than regular product development of iOS and Android apps. And we want to share our experience and knowledge. We are convinced that this is beneficial for the community and for ourselves. That is why we aim to conduct autotest workshops that anyone can join.</description>

      <description>Hi all,
We are announcing the launch of open-source cooperation between Avito and KasperskyÂ â€”Â Avokado. This is a project whose main goal is to develop tools that will make life easier for every mobile developer. We truly believe in synergy and that 1+1 can be more than 2. We are convinced that a team with a common goal can achieve more than a lone individual. And that it is worth sharing experience, knowledge, and tools, because in return you receive more than you give.</description>
