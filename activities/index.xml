      <description>Over the several years that we have been doing autotests for mobile apps, a great deal of valuable experience has been accumulated. Working on autotests, related tools and infrastructure requires different skills than regular product development of iOS and Android apps. And we want to share our experience and knowledge. We are convinced that this is beneficial for the community and for ourselves. That is why we aim to conduct autotest workshops that anyone can join.</description>
